`How to Find Out Who's Popular on Twitter. And why there's no point in doing it <https://medium.com/@ducu/d659884fd942>`

That’s easy. You just look at the number of followers, and you’ll get @katyperry, @justinbieber, and @BarackObama — the top most followed accounts in the whole Twitterverse. No surprise there, right?

But what if you want to focus on a particular group of Twitter users, for example the Hacker News community? Who’s in the top most followed accounts by the HNers? This is not a trivial exercise, we need a different approach, but if you’re a HNer, the result will be just as predictable.

Test Case
---------

HNers' Most Followed. 
Top most followed by @newsyc20 followers.

`screen_name = 'newsyc20'`
